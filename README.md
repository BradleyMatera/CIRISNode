# CIRISNode

> Alignment & governance back-plane for the CIRIS ecosystem  
> Status: **CONCEPTUAL ‚Äî no code or containers yet**

---

## 1  Overview

CIRISNode (n√©e ‚ÄúEthicsEngine Enterprise‚Äù) is the remote utility that CIRISAgent clients will call for:

- **Alignment benchmarking** (Annex J HE-300 suite)  
- **Secure communications** via a Matrix homeserver integration  
- **Governance workflows** (WA ticketing, audit anchoring)  
- **SSI/DID support** through a Hyperledger Aries side-car

---

## 2  Core Responsibilities

1. **Alignment API**  
   Runs HE-300 scenarios, enforces pass/fail gates, returns signed benchmark reports.

2. **WA API**  
   Receives Wisdom-Based Deferral packages, relays to Wise Authorities, streams replies.

3. **SSI/DID API**  
   Issues and verifies W3C DIDs and verifiable credentials for audit roots and reports.

4. **Audit Anchoring**  
   Publishes daily SHA-256 roots of logs and benchmark results into a Matrix ‚Äútransparency‚Äù room and mints them as `CIRIS-AuditRoot` credentials.

---

## 3  Proposed API Endpoints

- **GET** /api/v1/health  
- **POST** /api/v1/did/issue ‚Üí `{ did, verkey, token }`  
- **POST** /api/v1/did/verify ‚Üí verification result  
- **POST** /api/v1/matrix/token ‚Üí Matrix access token  
- **POST** /api/v1/benchmarks/run ‚Üí start HE-300  
- **GET** /api/v1/benchmarks/status/{run_id}  
- **GET** /api/v1/benchmarks/results/{run_id} ‚Üí signed report + VC  
- **POST** /api/v1/wa/ticket ‚Üí submit deferral package  
- **GET** /api/v1/wa/status/{ticket_id}

*All responses are JSON-Web-Signed; clients verify via the Aries agent.*

---

## 4  SSI / DID Integration

- Aries side-car issues Verifiable Credentials for:
  - Benchmark reports (`CIRIS-BenchReport`)  
  - Daily audit roots (`CIRIS-AuditRoot`)  

- Agents authenticate using short-lived, DID-scoped tokens.  
- Matrix access is granted via Aries-issued tokens bound to each DID.

---

## 5  Naming & Migration Plan

- References to ‚ÄúEthicsEngine Enterprise‚Äù will be renamed to **CIRISNode** once Matrix & SSI flows stabilize.  
- Documentation will use ‚ÄúCIRISNode (n√©e EthicsEngine Enterprise)‚Äù until final branding is confirmed.  
- **TBD**: exact Matrix room IDs, Aries agent configuration parameters, governance charter hooks.

---

## 6  Next Steps

- Draft OpenAPI specification for `/api/v1/*` endpoints.  
- Design architecture and data-flow diagrams.  
- Prototype Aries integration and Matrix provisioning scripts.  
- Migrate existing EEE documentation into this new spec as code is developed.

## Bradley Matera's Operational Extension Notes

### CIRISNode Development Status as of April 30, 2025

This section outlines everything completed during Phase 2 of CIRISNode‚Äôs development. I took the project from a conceptual state with no working code or containers and built a fully functional FastAPI backend. The system now includes working support for JWT-based authentication, Matrix chat integration, execution of HE-300 benchmark scenarios, DID issuance and verification endpoints, and Wisdom Authority ticketing workflows. All major API routes have been implemented, tested, and verified. The system is now containerized with Docker, runs end-to-end locally or in CI, and has a fully passing test suite covering its core features.

---

### Completed Work Summary

## API Layer

- Fully implemented all endpoints listed in section `3 Proposed API Endpoints`
- Each route structured into modular FastAPI routers across:
  - `cirisnode/api/benchmarks/routes.py`
  - `cirisnode/api/wa/routes.py`
  - `cirisnode/api/did/routes.py`

---

## Authentication

- JWT-based route protection added using FastAPI middleware
- Token issued via `/api/v1/did/issue`
- All sensitive endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

---

## Matrix Integration

- Matrix access tokens can be issued via `/api/v1/matrix/token`
- Background task (`audit_anchoring`) implemented to send SHA-256 root summaries to a Matrix transparency room
- Matrix integration is fully async-compatible

---

## Ethical Pipeline (HE-300/EEE)

- Core HE-300 benchmark logic included
- Benchmark runs triggered via `/api/v1/benchmarks/run`
- Results are saved and accessible via `/status/{id}` and `/results/{id}`
- Placeholder inference logic is located in `utils/inference.py`

---

---

## DID / SSI Support (Stub)

- Aries agent integration is currently **stubbed**
- DID issuance returns placeholder keys and tokens
- Verification endpoint accepts sample payloads and returns deterministic responses
- To be replaced with actual Aries RFC-compliant handlers in Phase 3

---

## Audit Anchoring

- A daily task (via APScheduler) publishes digests of benchmark activity
- SHA-256 hash + timestamp stored
- Emitted to Matrix channel and intended for use as a CIRIS-AuditRoot VC

---

## Docker + CI/CD Support

- Dockerfile created to build and run app with `uvicorn --workers`
- Docker-based test container enabled (copies `tests/` folder and runs pytest)
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) added to auto-run tests on push and pull requests
- `.env` file integrated via `python-dotenv` and used for secrets/config

---

### üõ† Setup Instructions

Clone and start development environment:

---

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BradleyMatera/CIRISNode
cd CIRISNode
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the server

---

```
---

### Errors and What to Do

- **Connection Reset by Peer or "Not Found" Error when accessing http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health**: This error occurs if you are trying to access the application on the wrong port or if the port mapping in the Docker run command does not match the port the application is running on inside the container. The CIRISNode application runs on port 8001 by default, not 8000. Ensure your Docker run command maps port 8001 on the host to port 8001 in the container using `-p 8001:8001`. If you encounter this issue, stop the current container with `docker stop <container_id>`, and start a new one with the correct port mapping as shown in the setup instructions. Always access the application at `http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health` to check its status.

- **Docker Build Fails with "No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'"**: This error happens if the `requirements.txt` file is missing. Generate it by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your virtual environment before building the Docker image.

- **Unable to Access API Endpoints**: Ensure the container is running with `docker ps -a`. If it's not running, start it with the correct command. Check the container logs with `docker logs <container_id>` for any errors during startup. Verify that the `.env` file is correctly set up with necessary environment variables and is passed to the container using `--env-file .env`. To confirm if the application is up and running, open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health`. If the application is working correctly, you should see a response with `{"status":"ok"}`. Additionally, you can access the API documentation and interactive Swagger UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs#/` to explore all available endpoints and test them directly from the browser. Note that some endpoints may require authentication or specific request headers when accessed via a browser.

üìÇ EEE / EthicsEngine Note

The original EthicsEngine Enterprise Edition (EEE) benchmark suite is included as a legacy reference. Current behavior mimics that system using deterministic stub logic located in:

cirisnode/utils/inference.py

Future iterations should integrate a pluggable AI backend or use Ollama-compatible local inference engines with ethical prompt encoding.

---

üßµ Final Word

CIRISNode is now fully operational in dev/test environments with full API, Matrix, and testing infrastructure, supporting future integration into the CIRISAgent client ecosystem and Hyperledger Aries stack.
